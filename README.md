## Description

In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in Stockholm city to overall global temperature trends. I will describe the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Stockholm.

I will try to anser to the following questions:
* Is Stockholm city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
* How do the changes in Stockholmâ€™s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
* What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

## Tools & Dependencies

In this project, I have focused on global and Stockolm's temperature data from 1750 to 2013.

The data is stored in the `/data/` folder of the project files.

Analysis has been performed in the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), using Python 3.x.
